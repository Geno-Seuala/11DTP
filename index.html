                <h1>What is Basketball?</h1>
                <div id="aboutbballbody">
                    <p>Basketball. A game originating from an American YMCA in 1891, is a game played by up to 26 players on 10 foot tall iron hoops and tempered glass backboards in which both teams must advance a leather ball up their respective sides of the court in the hopes of scoring a "basket". The game has evolved tremendously over the last 100+ years. With new rule changes, associations, and sponsorships, the basketball industry is now worth well over ten billion dollars and is proving to be a viable career path for many young athletes. At Northhaven, we provide our athletes with exceptional athletic training, incredible recovery and meal plans, and top-tier education opening doors to virtually every industry outside of basketball. This is made possible by our incredible team of staff, lead my Mr. Steven Pingdale, our program stands tall amongst a nation of outstanding athleticism as a beacon of premier development and learning.</p>
